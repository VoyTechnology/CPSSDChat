In VERY early stage of development. PLEASE IGNORE

# Installation #

Currently no installer, tested and written on Elementary OS

1. Download a web server (its only serving static requests)
2. Download node.js (I am using io.js via nvm)
3. Clone this git repo
4. Point you web server root at the `public_html` folder
5. Start the `app.js` using `nodemon` or just `node`
6. Navigate to your web address to see what works and what doesn't.

# Playing around #
